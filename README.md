# Challenge Code

## Identification of the problem solved by building this particular marketplace app
Challenge Code has a straight forward means of describing any question and answer format problem in the form of a descrete challenge. This provides a rapid and ad-hoc mechanism for creating individual or grouped problem sets for any purpose (eg. education, recreational problem solving). The ability to see what challenges have been completed provides a way to track your progress and the progress of other users. I can also be considered akin to a pastbin-like platform but for problem solving challenges.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving? 
Expedient creation of question & answer problems with minimal bloat provides a headache free and fast solution to authoring and publishing such problems. And a simple progress tracking and challenge listing makes Challenge Code perfect for on the fly coding/math/other challenge practice.
